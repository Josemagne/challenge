## Note

### Data

The data /assets/data/data.json is from alphavantage.
I do not know what is being fetched. Therefore I stick with the term 'data',

### State Management

I used redux toolkit for a central state management. I used to pass down props with but it is much more comfortable to have the state on a single spot.
